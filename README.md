# Powershell
For my PowerShell scripts

"Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braydenhoralcher/Powershell/main/AutomationScripts.ps1'))"

Copy and paste the code in quotation marks and save it as a .ps1 file

Everything can be run through the one script
